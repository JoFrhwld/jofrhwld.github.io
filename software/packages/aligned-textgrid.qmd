abstract: 'The aligned-textgrid package provides a python interface for representing and operating on TextGrids produced by forced aligners like FAVE or the Montreal Forced Aligner. Classes provided by aligned-textgrid represent hierarchical and precedence relationships among data stored in TextGrid formats allowing for simplified and more accessible analysis of aligned speech data.'
