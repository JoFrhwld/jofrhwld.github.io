The world is a very complex place, so there is no way you could cram it all into a bottle, but give it your best shot! If during the course of your data analysis, you find that it would have been really useful to have data on, say, duration, as well as formant frequencies, it becomes costly to recollect that data, especially if you haven't laid the proper trail for yourself. On the other hand, *automation* of acoustic analysis or data processing can cut down on this costliness.\n\nThis doesn't go for personal information on human subjects, though. It's important from an ethics standpoint to ask for everything you'll need, but not more. You don't want to collect an enormous demographic profile on your participants if you won't wind up using it, especially if you know you won't use it to begin with.\n\n### Preserve HiD Info\n\nIf, for instance, you're collecting data on the effect of voicing on preceding vowel duration, preserve high dimensional data coding, like Lexical Item, or the transcription of the following segment. These high dimensional codings probably won't be too useful for your immediate analysis, but they will allow you to procedurally extract additional features from them at a later time. For example, if you have a column called `fol_seg`, which is just a transcription of the following segment, it is easy create a new column called `manner` with code that looks like this:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntable(iy_ah$fol_seg)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n\n```\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'iy_ah' not found\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\niy_ah <- iy_ah %>%\n  mutate(\n    manner = recode(\n      fol_seg, \n      B = 'stop',\n      CH = 'affricate',\n      D = 'stop',\n      DH = 'fricative',\n      `F` = 'fricative',\n      G = 'stop',\n      HH = 'fricative',\n      JH = 'affricate',\n      K = 'stop',\n      L = 'liquid',\n      M = 'nasal',\n      N = 'nasal',\n      NG = 'nasal',\n      P = 'stop',\n      R = 'liquid',\n      S = 'fricative',\n      SH = 'fricative',\n      SP = 'pause',\n      `T` = 'stop',\n      TH = 'fricative',\n      V = 'fricative',\n      W = 'glide',\n      Y = 'glide',\n      Z = 'fricative',\n      ZH = 'fricative',\n      .default = 'vowel'\n    )\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n\n```\nError in iy_ah %>% mutate(manner = recode(fol_seg, B = \"stop\", CH = \"affricate\", : could not find function \"%>%\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntable(iy_ah$manner)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n\n```\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'iy_ah' not found\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Leave A Trail of Crumbs\n\nBe sure to answer this question: How can I preserve a record of this observation in such a way that I can quickly return to it and gather more data on it if necessary? If you fail to successfully answer this question, then you'll be lost in the woods if you ever want to restudy, and the only way home is to replicate the study from scratch.\n\n### Give Meaningful Names\n\nGive meaningful names to both the names of predictor columns, as well as to labels of nominal observations. Keeping a readme describing the data is still a good idea, but at least now the data is approachable at first glance.\n\n### Distinguish between `0` and `NA`\n\nI have worked with some spreadsheets where missing data was given a value of `0`, which will mess things up. For example, /oy/ is a fairly rarely occurring phoneme in English, and it's possible that a speaker won't produce any tokens in a short interview. In a spreadsheet of mean F1 and F2 for all vowels, that speaker should get an `NA` for /oy/, **not** `0`.\n\n## Storing Data\n\nWhen we store data, it should be:\n\nRaw\n\n:   Raw data is the most useful data. It's impossible to move down to smaller granularity from a coarser, summarized granularity. Summary tables etc. are nice for publishing in a paper document, but raw data is what we need for asking novel research questions with old data.\n\nOpen Formatted\n\n:   Do not use proprietary database software for long term storage of your data. I have enough heard stories about interesting data sets that are no longer accessible for research either because the software they are stored in is defunct, or current versions are not backwards compatible. At that point, your data is property of Microsoft, or whoever. Store your data as raw text, delimited in some way (I prefer tabs).\n\nConsistent\n\n:   I think this is most important when you may have data in many separate files. Each file and its headers should be consistently named and formatted. They should be consistently delimited and commented also. There is nothing worse than inconsistent headers and erratic comments, labels, headers or NA characters in a corpus. (Automation also helps here.)\n\nDocumented\n\n:   Produce a readme describing the data, how it was collected and processed, and describe every variable and its possible values.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Structuring Data\n\n## Breaking Bad Spreadsheet Habits\n\nLet's start off by looking at a picture of a data organization approach that might look familiar, and is a *very bad* way to do things:\n\n![](figures/bad_spreadsheet.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"100%\"}\n\nThis spreadsheet has a fairly strict organizational structure, but is virtuously hopeless for doing any kind of serious statistical analysis. It's also verging on irreparable using R. This because the data in this spreadsheet is organized to be easy to look at with your eyeballs ðŸ‘€.\n\nBut looking at neatly organized data in a spreadsheet is not a statistical analysis technique. So we need to start organizing our data in a way that isn't easy to look at, but *is* easy to graph and analyze.\n\n## Better Habits\n\nEveryone working with data (in R or otherwise) should read Hadley Wickham's paper on Tidy Data: <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html> If you are coming off of organizing your data like the picture above, there are a few guidelines not discussed in that paper, namely:\n\n#### Follow these rules\n\n1.  The first row of the data *must* be the names of the data columns.\n2.  All other rows *must* be the data, and nothing else.\n3.  You cannot use empty rows or empty columns as visual aids to look at the data.\n4.  The spreadsheet must not contain any summary cells. No final row called \"Average\" or final column called \"Total\". We can create these in R, and they make data processing more complicated if they're included in the raw data.\n\n### Semantics of Data Structure\n\nIn the semantics of data structure Wickham lays out, there are three important primitives:\n\n1.  Variables\n2.  Values\n3.  Observations\n\n#### Defining the primitives\n\n##### Variables\n\nVariables are the collections of values of interest in data analysis. For example, let's say you were doing a study on unnormalized vowel space size by just looking at /i:/ and /É‘/. The variables in that study could be:\n\n-   `speaker`\n-   `word`\n-   `phoneme`\n-   `duration`\n-   `F1`\n-   `F2`\n-   `word_frequency`\n\n##### Values\n\nValues are, as the name implies, the possible values that each variable can have, for example:\n\n-   `speaker`: `\"Oakley\"`, `\"Charlie\"`, `\"Azaria\"`, `...`\n-   `word`: `\"street\"`, `\"thirteen\"`, `\"not\"`, `\"got\"`, `...`\n-   `phoneme`: `\"iy\"`, `\"ah\"`\n\n##### Observations\n\nAn observation is the minimal unit across which all variables are collected. For example, in the vowel space study, one observation would be one instance of an uttered vowel for which you record who the speaker was, the word, the duration, F1, F2, etc.\n\n#### Organizing data with these primitives\n\nOnce you've thought through what the variables, values and observations are for your study, the principle of how to organize them is simple:\n\n1.  Each variable forms a column.\n2.  Each observation forms a row.\n\nFor the vowel space size study, you might want to wind up with a plot that looks like this:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n\n```\nError in iy_ah %>% group_by(idstring, sex, age, plt_vclass) %>% summarise(F1 = mean(F1), : could not find function \"%>%\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIt wouldn't be uncommon to see the data untidily organized like this:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n\n```\nError in iy_ah %>% group_by(idstring, sex, age, plt_vclass) %>% summarise(F1 = mean(F1), : could not find function \"%>%\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: callout-note\n## \\~5 minute activity\n\nIn small groups, figure out the following:\n\n-   What are the variables in the data frame above?\n-   What are the values?\n-   What are the observations?\n-   How should the table above be re-organized?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n\n```\nError in iy_ah %>% group_by(idstring, sex, age, plt_vclass) %>% summarise(F1 = mean(F1), : could not find function \"%>%\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n# Data Frames\n\nSo far we have discussed the following types of values in R:\n\n-   numerical\n-   character\n-   logical\n\nAnd we've discussed the following data structures.\n\n-   vectors\n\nHere, we'll cover one new data structure:\n\n-   data frames\n\nData Frames are the data structure we'll be using the most in R. When you begin thinking about data frames, a useful starting place is to think of them as spreadsheets, with columns and rows (but we'll eventually abandon spreadsheet thinking). Let's start out by creating a very simple data frame using the `data.frame()` function.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npitch <- data.frame(\n  speaker_names = c(\"Charlie\", \"Skyler\", \"Sawyer\", \"Jamie\"),\n  ages = c(18, 35, 41, 62),\n  F0 = c(114, 189, 189, 199)\n)\n\npitch\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n  speaker_names ages  F0\n1       Charlie   18 114\n2        Skyler   35 189\n3        Sawyer   41 189\n4         Jamie   62 199\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Finding your way around\n\nThe `pitch` data frame has four rows, and three columns. The rows are just numbered 1 through 4, and the three columns are named `speaker_names`, `ages` and `F0`. To find out how many rows and columns a data frame has, you can use the `nrow()` and `ncol()` functions.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnrow(pitch)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 4\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nncol(pitch)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 3\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nMost data frames you're going to work with have a lot more rows than that. For example, `iy_ah` is a data frame that is bundled in the `lsa2017` package.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnrow(iy_ah)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n\n```\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'iy_ah' not found\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThat's too many rows to look at just in the console. One option is to use the `head()` function, that just prints the first 6 rows.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhead(iy_ah)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n\n```\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'iy_ah' not found\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnother option is to use the `summary()` function.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummary(iy_ah)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n\n```\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'iy_ah' not found\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n`summary()` is a function that works on almost every kind of object.\n\n## Indexing Data Frames\n\nSince data frames are 2 dimensional (rows are one dimension, columns are another), the way you index them is a little bit more complicated than with vectors. It still uses square brackets, though, but these square brackets have two positions:\n\n::: {style=\"font-family:monospace;font-size:xx-large;text-align:center;\"}\n[df]{style=\"color:#747474\"}[\\[]{style=\"color:red\"}[row number]{style=\"color:#747474\"}[,]{style=\"color:red\"} [column number]{style=\"color:#747474\"}[\\]]{style=\"color:red\"}\n:::\n\nIf you specify a specific row number, but leave the column number blank, you'll get back that row and all columns.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npitch[1,]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n  speaker_names ages  F0\n1       Charlie   18 114\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAlternatively, if you specify just the column number, but leave the rows blank, you'll get back all of the values for that column.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npitch[,2]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 18 35 41 62\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhen you specify both, you get back the value in the specified row and column\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npitch[1,2]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 18\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nHowever, there is a special indexing operator for data frames that take advantage of their named columns: `$`.\n\n::: {style=\"font-family:monospace;font-size:xx-large;text-align:center\"}\n[df]{style=\"color:#747474\"}[\\$]{style=\"color:red\"}[column_name]{style=\"color:#747474\"}\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npitch$speaker_names\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"Charlie\" \"Skyler\"  \"Sawyer\"  \"Jamie\"  \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAfter accessing the column of a data frame, you can index it just like it's a vector.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npitch$speaker_names[1]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"Charlie\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIf you really want to, you can do logical indexing of data frames like so:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npitch[pitch$speaker_names == \"Charlie\", ]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n  speaker_names ages  F0\n1       Charlie   18 114\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nBut there's also a function called `filter()` that you can use to do the same thing. `filter()` takes a data frame as its first argument, and then a logical statement referring to one or more of the data frame's columns.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfilter(pitch, speaker_names == \"Charlie\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n\n```\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'speaker_names' not found\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfilter(pitch, ages > 18, F0 > 190)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n\n```\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'F0' not found\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: callout-note\n## \\~5 minute activity\n\nFirst, review the documentation of the `iy_ah` data set with `?iy_ah`. Using `filter()` and `nrow()`, find out what percent of /i:/ tokens have a duration less than 90ms (0.09s).\n:::\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Reading Data into R\n\nR can easily read comma-separated (.csv) files and tab-delimited files into its memory.[^1] You can read them in with `read.csv()` and `read.delim()`, respectively. If your data is unavoidably in an Excel spreadsheet, there is a package called `readxl` with a function called `read_excel()` If you have the `readxl` package installed, I *strongly* recommend reading over its documentation on sheet geometry by calling up the vignette like so:\n\n[^1]: My personal aesthetic preference is for tab-delimited files.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nvignette(\"sheet-geometry\", package = \"readxl\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n**Last Minute Update**: There is also package for reading data in from google spreadsheets <https://github.com/jennybc/googlesheets>. I haven't used it yet, but it's gotten good reviews.\n\nWhen loading a data file into R, you are just loading it into the R workspace. Any alterations or modifications you make to the data frame will not be reflected in the file in your system, *just* in the copy in the R workspace.\n\nThe tricky thing now is that the way that feels most natural or normal for you to organize and name your files and folders doesn't necessarily translate into a good way for R (or other programming languages) to look at them. In order to load a file into R, you need to provide `read.csv()` or `read.delim()` with the \"path\" to the file, which is just a text string.\n\nFor example, here's a screenshot of a data file I'd like to load into R.\n\n![](figures/file.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"100%\"}\n\nI have the option turned on in my system to see the full path at the bottom of the file window, so you can see a full list of all of the folders this data file is embedded in. In order to read this data into R, you need to type out the full path, although a nice thing about\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\njoe_vowels <- read.csv(\"~/ownCloud/DocSyncUoE/Courses/LSA/data/joe_vowels.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nIf you're not sure what it looks like on your system, use the `file.choose()` function.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfile.choose()\n```\n:::\n\n\nThat'll launch the default visual file browser for your system. After browsing around and clicking on a file, `file.choose()` will print the character string that represents the path to that file into the console.\n\n::: callout-tip\n## Hygiene\n\nDon't rely heavily on `file.choose()`. Sometimes, I've seen R scripts with the following line of code in it:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata <- read.csv(file.choose())\n```\n:::\n\n\nPlease never do this. I would caution against using it in any code, scripts or notebooks at all. Only ever use it to refresh your memory of where your data is located. By always writing out the the text of the path to the data, you\n\n-   produce more transparent code\n-   allow yourself to re-run your analysis without needing to click around\n-   ensure that you're using the same data file every single time\n:::\n\nOne pretty cool thing is that if a data file is up on a website somewhere, you can just access it by passing the url to `read.csv()` or `read.delim()`.[^2] Here is some sample data on the Donner Party.[^3]\n\n[^2]: This doesn't work if the file is behind encryption, i.e. if it begins with `https://`.\n\n[^3]: \"The Donner Party (sometimes called the Donner-Reed Party) was a group of American pioneer migrants who set out for California in a wagon train. Delayed by a series of mishaps, they spent the winter of 1846--47 snowbound in the Sierra Nevadas.

Let's quickly go over how to tidy up messy data a little.\n\nFirst, let's look at the wide `iy_ah_wide` dataframe, which is part of the `lsa2017` package.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\niy_ah_wide\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n\n```\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'iy_ah_wide' not found\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe problem with this data is\n\n-   There are *values* spread across the columns.\n-   Individual column names have combined these *values* with some *variables*.\n\nGetting to a tidier format of the data will involve a three step process:\n\n1.  Converting this wide data format to a long data format.\n2.  Separating the vowel class values from the formant variable.\n3.  Spreading the formant variables back out along the column space.'\n\nWe can do this easily with the functions `gather()`, `separate()` and `spread()` from the `tidyr` package.\n\nFor a smaller illustrative purpose for people who may feel uneasy about vowels and formants, I'll be illustrating each of these steps with a simpler data set about how many apples and oranges two people bought, and how many they ate.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfruit <- data.frame(person = c(\"Oakley\", \"Charlie\"),\n                 apples_bought = c(5, 3),\n                 apples_ate = c(1, 2),\n                 oranges_bought = c(5, 4),\n                 oranges_ate = c(3, 3))\n```\n:::\n\n\n|person  | apples_bought| apples_ate| oranges_bought| oranges_ate|\n|:-------|-------------:|----------:|--------------:|-----------:|\n|Oakley  |             5|          1|              5|           3|\n|Charlie |             3|          2|              4|           3|\n\n\nNote, even though the column labels look different, this is is an equivalent table to formatting involving merged column label cells.\n\n::: half-img\n![](figures/merge_tab.png)\n:::\n\n## Gathering Columns\n\nThe `gather()` function makes *wide* data *long.* It takes the following arguments:\n\n::: illustrate\ngather([data]{.pop}, [key]{.pop}, [value]{.pop}, cols)\n:::\n\n-   `data`\n    -   Obviously, the data you want to reshape. must be a data frame.\n-   `key` and `value`\n    -   These are new column names that you want to create. `gather()` is going to take the column names and put them in the column you give to `key`, and the values from all the cells and put them in the column you call `value`.\n-   `cols`\n    -   An indication of which columns you want to gather, either a vector of column names, a vector of column numbers, or some specialized methods for `gather()` that we'll discuss.\n\nHere's how that'll work for the fruit data. We'll tell `gather()` to gather columns 2 through 5.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfruit_long <- gather(data = fruit,\n                     key = fruit_behavior,\n                     value = number,\n                     2:5)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n\n```\nError in gather(data = fruit, key = fruit_behavior, value = number, 2:5): could not find function \"gather\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n```\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'fruit_long' not found\n```\n\n\n`gather()` has returned a new data frame. It has created a new column called `fruit_behavior`, because we told it to with the `key` argument, and it has created a new column called `number`, because we told it to with the `value` function. It has taken all of the column names of the columns we told it to gather, and put them into the `fruit_behavior` column, and the numeric values from the columns we told it to gather, and put them into the `number` column. It has also repeated the rows of the other columns (`person`) as logically necessary.\n\nNow, we told it to gather column numbers 2 through 5, but this would have also worked:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngather(data = fruit, \n       key = fruit_behavior, \n       value = number, \n       c(\"apples_bought\",\"apples_ate\", \"oranges_bought\", \"oranges_ate\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n\n```\nError in gather(data = fruit, key = fruit_behavior, value = number, c(\"apples_bought\", : could not find function \"gather\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n`gather()` also has a more convenient method of specifying the columns you want to gather by passing it a named range of columns. We want to gather all columns from `apples_bought` to `oranges_ate`, so we can tell it to do so with `apples_bought:oranges_ate`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngather(data = fruit, \n       key = fruit_behavior, \n       value = number, \n       apples_bought:oranges_ate)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n\n```\nError in gather(data = fruit, key = fruit_behavior, value = number, apples_bought:oranges_ate): could not find function \"gather\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOk, let's do this now to the `iy_ah_wide` data, gathering all of the columns from `ah_F1` to `iy_F2`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\niy_ah_step1 <- gather(data = iy_ah_wide, \n                      key = vowel_formant, \n                      value = hz, \n                      ah_F1:iy_F2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n\n```\nError in gather(data = iy_ah_wide, key = vowel_formant, value = hz, ah_F1:iy_F2): could not find function \"gather\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\niy_ah_step1\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n\n```\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'iy_ah_step1' not found\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFor the fruit data, the only un-gathered column was `person`, but for `iy_ah_wide`, `idstring`, `age`, `sex`, and `year`, were all ungathered. Here you can see how all rows of ungathered columns are repeated as logically necessary.\n\n## Separating Columns\n\nThere is still a problem with both the `fruit_long` and the `iy_ah_step1` data frames, which is that two different kinds of data are merged within one column. For `iy_ah_step1`, the vowel class and formant variable are merged together (e.g. `ah_F1`) and for `fruit_long`, the fruit and behavior are merged together (e.g. `apple_bought`). We need to separate these, with a very aptly named function called `separate()`\n\n::: illustrate\nseparate([data]{.pop}, [col]{.pop}, [into]{.pop}, [sep]{.pop})\n:::\n\n-   `data`\n    -   Again,the data frame you want to do this separation to.\n-   `col`\n    -   The name of the column you want to separate.\n-   `into`\n    -   A character vector of the new column names you want to create.\n-   `sep`\n    -   The character or regex pattern you want to use to split up the values in `col`.\n\nHere's how it works for `fruit_long`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfruit_separate <- separate(data = fruit_long,\n                           col = fruit_behavior,\n                           into = c(\"fruit\", \"behavior\"),\n                           sep = \"_\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n\n```\nError in separate(data = fruit_long, col = fruit_behavior, into = c(\"fruit\", : could not find function \"separate\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n```\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'fruit_separate' not found\n```\n\n\nIt has returned a new data frame with the `fruit_behavior` column split into two new columns, named after what I passed to the `into` argument. It split up `fruit_behavior` based on what I passed to `sep`, which was the underscore character.\n\nLet's do this for `iy_ah_step1` now.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\niy_ah_step2 <- separate(iy_ah_step1, \n                        vowel_formant, \n                        into = c(\"vowel\", \"formant\"),\n                        sep = \"_\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n\n```\nError in separate(iy_ah_step1, vowel_formant, into = c(\"vowel\", \"formant\"), : could not find function \"separate\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\niy_ah_step2\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n\n```\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'iy_ah_step2' not found\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe now have two separate columns for `vowel` and `formant`.\n\n::: {.box .hygiene}\n[Hygiene]{.label}\n\nI have been very helpful and used underscores to merge together the values we want to separate. Be helpful to yourself, and be consistent in the semantics of how you used potential delimiters like `-` and `_`. Here's an example of being helpful to yourself:\n\n```         \nproject_subject_firstname-lastname\n\nEDI_1_Stuart-Duddingston\nEDI_2_Connor-Black-Macdowall\nEDI_3_Mhairi\n```\n\nThis is helpful, because when you separate by underscore, you'll have something tidy\n\n```         \nEDI    1    Stuart-Duddingston\nEDI    2    Connor-Black-Macdowall\nEDI    3    Mhairi\n```\n\nIf you used `-` for everything, you'll have chaos when you try to separate them because some speakers have \"double barreled\" names, and some speakers have only first names:\n\n```         \n# Input:\nEDI-1-Stuart-Duddingston\nEDI-2-Connor-Black-Macdowall\nEDI-3-Mhairi\n\n# Becomes\n\nEDI    1    Stuart    Duddingston\nEDI    2    Connor    Black        Macdowall\nEDI    3    Mhairi\n```\n\nThis goes beyond R programming. You should make some decisions and stick with them for all of your data analysis, including file naming, Praat tier naming, etc.\n:::\n\n## Spreading columns\n\nWe've got one last step, which is spreading the values in some rows across the column space. With the `fruit` data, we might not want a column called `behavior`, but actually have two columns called `bought` and `ate`. For the vowel data, we definitely don't want one column called `formant`. We want one called `F1` and one called `F2`. We can do this with the `spread()` function.\n\n::: illustrate\nspread([data]{.pop}, [key]{.pop}, [value]{.pop})\n:::\n\n-   `data`\n    -   Again, the data we want to work with.\n-   `key`\n    -   The column whose values you want to spread across the column space.\n-   `value`\n    -   The column with values that you want to fill in the cells.\n\nHere's how that looks with the `fruit_separate` data.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfruit_spread <- spread(data = fruit_separate,\n                       key = behavior,\n                       value = number)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n\n```\nError in spread(data = fruit_separate, key = behavior, value = number): could not find function \"spread\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n```\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'fruit_spread' not found\n```\n\n\nThis has created a new data frame. I told `spread()` to spread the values in `behavior` across the column space. Because it had only two unique values in it (`bought` and `ate`), it has created two new columns called `bought` and `ate`. After creating these new columns, it had to fill in the new cells with some values, and I told it to use the values in `number` for that.\n\nHere's how that works with `iy_ah_step2`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\niy_ah_step3 <- spread(data = iy_ah_step2,\n                      key = formant,\n                      value = hz)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n\n```\nError in spread(data = iy_ah_step2, key = formant, value = hz): could not find function \"spread\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\niy_ah_step3\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n\n```\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'iy_ah_step3' not found\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNow, we've finally gotten to a tidy data format. In our next meeting, we'll discuss how to chain these three functions into one easy to read process.\n\n::: {.box .idiom}\n[Idiom]{.label}\n\nYou might have noticed that in the functions above, I've put a new line between individual function arguments. I've done this because white-space doesn't matter when it comes to R. I could have written these with just spaces between each argument, but that would be too visually crowded.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# compare\n\n# One line\nfruit_separate <- separate(data = fruit_long, col = fruit_behavior, into = c(\"fruit\", \"behavior\"), sep = \"_\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n\n```\nError in separate(data = fruit_long, col = fruit_behavior, into = c(\"fruit\", : could not find function \"separate\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# New Lines\nfruit_separate <- separate(data = fruit_long, \n                           col = fruit_behavior, \n                           into = c(\"fruit\", \"behavior\"), \n                           sep = \"_\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n\n```\nError in separate(data = fruit_long, col = fruit_behavior, into = c(\"fruit\", : could not find function \"separate\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nI encourage you to use new lines similarly to give yourself \"some space to breathe\". Don't be shy about it. But, if you put newlines between *some* arguments, you should really put new lines between *all* arguments.\n:::\n",
