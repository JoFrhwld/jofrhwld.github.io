					We explore the novel results made possible by fitting hierarchical models to speech community data. 			Specifically, these models produce estimates for the degree to which a speech community coheres to  			a communal norm.

					In this paper, I will be focusing on the difference between semiweak and regular past tense in terms of TD Deletion. Specifically, I will pursue a revised version of the analysis in Guy and Boyd (1990), casting it in terms of Competing Grammars (Kroch, 1989) and Distributed Morphology (Halle and

				<h3>Abstract</h3>
				
				
				<p>
					
					The detailed quantitative study of language change, as found in studies such as Labov (1994) and Kroch (1989), has raised two central questions for linguistic theory. The first is an issue in the theory of language change itself, namely: do changes in different components of the grammar progress in the

				<h3>Abstract</h3>
				
				
				<p>
					
					The centralization of the low upgliding diphthong (typically called Canadian Raising, here just Raising), is frequently cited as an example of phonological opacity. Conditioned by a following voiceless segment, Raising continues to apply when an underlying unstressed /t/ is flapped on the surface. Dialects which have both Raising and Flapping,

				<h3>Abstract</h3>
				
				
				<p>
					
					Canadian Raising is typically described as the centralization of the nucleus of /ay/ before voiceless segments. However some recent studies in areas affected by Raising have shown that the current conditioning factors are not as regular as reported previously (Vance, 1987; Dailey-OCain, 1997; Hall, 2005). This paper explores the status
