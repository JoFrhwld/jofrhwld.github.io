abstract: "The study and formalization of intra-speaker variation within variationist\
  \ sociolinguistics has followed a largely parallel history with generative phonology,\
  \ always borrowing heavily from the generative theories of the day. More recently,\
  \ structured probabilistic variation has become enshrined as a fact-to-be-explained\
  \ by any theory of human sound systems in more mainstream phonology. This chapter\
  \ outlines this parallel history of variation study from its origins in dialectology,\
  \ the evolution of modern variationist sociolinguistics, and the development of\
  \ more contemporary variation focused phonological theory, as well as critiques\
  \ that have been posed over this history. The chapter reviews in considerable detail\
  \ how the original notion of \u2018variable rule\u2019 was elaborated and complexified,\
  \ and how variation is treated in constraint-based approaches. It concludes with\
  \ a look towards the future of variation study that is incorporating more insights\
  \ from psycholinguistics."
