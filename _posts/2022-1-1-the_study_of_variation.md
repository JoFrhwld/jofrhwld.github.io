abstract: "As pointed out by Coetzee (2009), the study of what is still often called\
  \ \u201Cfree variation\u201D (but not by those who study it) has followed a largely\
  \ parallel history to the development of Generative Phonology following SPE. Weinreich\
  \ et al. (1968) stands as the programmatic document for the subfield of Variationism,\
  \ and was published the same year as SPE. Since that time, variation theory has\
  \ continued to develop, and some aspects of it have become partially incorporated\
  \ into mainstream phonological theory. This chapter will outline the development\
  \ of variation theory, how it touches on current topics in phonology, and the direction\
  \ that variation theory seems to be moving into the future."
