abstract: The centralization of the low upgliding diphthong (typically called Canadian
  Raising, here just Raising), is frequently cited as an example of phonological opacity.
  Conditioned by a following voiceless segment, Raising continues to apply when an
  underlying unstressed /t/ is flapped on the surface. Dialects which have both Raising
  and Flapping, then, maintain the distinction between "writer" and "rider" in the
  quality of the vowel, rather than the voicing of the stop. Exceptions to the simplest
  formulation of Raising have been reported on in the past. Underapplication of Raising
  in pre-voiceless environments can possibly be accounted for by prosodic structure
  (Chambers, 1973, 1989; Jensen, 2000; Vance, 1987). However, a few reports from the
  Inland North (Vance, 1987; Dailey-O'Cain, 1997) and Canada (Hall, 2005) suggest
  that the regularity of Raising's conditioning has deteriorated, allowing raised
  nuclei before underlyingly voiced segments. The distribution of these raised variants
  is unpredictable within a speaker's phonology, but stable for given words, suggesting
  that Raising has lexicalized, and is undergoing diffusion to new environments. This
  paper focuses on the phonological status of Raising in Philadelphia. Raising was
  identified as an incipient sound change in progress in the LCV study of the 1970s,
  and has been revisited for study in connection with its masculine association (Labov,
  2001; Conn, 2005; Wagner, 2007). After examining data from 12 boys, ages 14 through
  19, it appears that Raising has lexicalized here as well. [{\textasciicircum}y]
  frequently appears before underlyingly voiced stops, as well as before nasals, but
  not in a phonologically predictable manner. Certain words seem to be selected for
  consistent overapplication however. "Spider" and "cider" are lexical items with
  raised nuclei for which there is broad agreement between speakers. However, there
  are also a number of lexical items which show more interspeaker variation, such
  as "tiny", produced variably as [tayni] or [t{\textasciicircum}yni]. Importantly,
  across all of the data, the effect of the lexical item on overapplication of Raising
  is stronger and more significant than the effect of surrounding phonological environment.
