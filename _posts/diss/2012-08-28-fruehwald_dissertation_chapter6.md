title: "Chapter 6: Against Gradual Phonologization"
year: 2013
author: [ { name: "Josef Fruehwald", url: "//jofrhwld.github.io/" }]
abstract: "<p>
In this chapter, I argue against a model of gradual phonologization wherby small phonetic errors gradually accumulate into a new phonological process or category. Based on the results from Chapters 4 and 5, it really looks like new phonological processes enter the grammar at the <i>onset</i> of phonetic changes. Of course, this is somewhat controversial, and the suggestion that new phonological processes enter the grammar before they have robust phonetic correlates may strain credulity. So, I spend most of the rest of the chapter further arguing for the plausibility of this scenario.

<p>
My favorite figure from this chapter shows the conditioning on /ey/ raising that I discovered in Chapter 5. Surprisingly, even though a following /l/ appears to most favor the change at the beginning, /ey/ actually never undergoes the change in this context.
