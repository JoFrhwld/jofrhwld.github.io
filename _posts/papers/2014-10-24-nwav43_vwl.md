abstract: "Dinkin (2013) proposed that /&aelig;l/ has merged to /awl/ in the Philadelphia dialect. He argued that:
<ol>
<li>/l/ has replaced /w/ as the offglide target for /aw/.</li>
<li>This facilitated the merger of /&aelig;l/ to /awl/.</li>
</ol>
I extend this argument to /uwl/ and /owl/. Using vowel trajectory data from the Philadelphia Neighborhood corpus (Labov & Rosenfelder, 2011, Rosenfelder et al, 2014), I argue that
<ol>
<li>/uwl/ and /owl/ have different glide targets from /uw/ and /ow/.</li>
<li>Their glide target is probably /l/.</li>
</ol>
This means that the the process affecting /uw, ow, aw/ can be generalized to one phonological process.
<ul>
<li>Vw &rarr; Vl / __l</li>
</ul>
This is an interesting example of the phonological class [Vw] doing double duty:
<ol>
<li>Defining a set of vowels to undergo a phonological process.</li>
<li>Defining a set of vowels to undergo a diachronic phonetic change (Labov, Rosenfelder & Fruehwald, 2013).</li>
</ol>
