title: "Social Meaning and Information Theory"

abstract: "I applied information theoretic principles to evaluate the informativity of a linguistic variable as a signaling system for gender, and compared it to a known signaling system for gender (properties of given names). The result is that despite the large gender differences in the linguistic variable, it performs poorly as a signal."
