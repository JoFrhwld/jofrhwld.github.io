title: "The Phonological Influence on Phonetic Change"
year: 2013
author: [ { name: "Josef Fruehwald", url: "jofrhwld.github.io" }]
abstract: "There is a conventional wisdom regarding phonetic changes that their grounding and motivating forces are similarly phonetic, e.g. the gradual accumulation of perceptual and articulatory errors, which I will argue is at best incomplete. In investigating language changes in progress as observed in the Philadelphia Neighborhood Corpus (Labov, Rosenfelder & Fruehwald 2013), I found that most of them (in fact, all of the ones I investigated) exhibited properties best attributable to a categorical, phonological influence. These include:

* categorical selection of some contexts to undergo change at the onset, which are best described phonologically, not phonetically,

* the categorical exclusion of some contexts from undergoing a change, despite appearing to favor it,

* the failure strong phonetic effects to phonologize,

* natural class behavior, not easily attributable to phonetic interactions (i.e. parallel shifts).

In my talk, I describe these results and try to make the case for more phonological analyses of phonetic changes.
