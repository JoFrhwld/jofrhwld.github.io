abstract: "Recent advances in access to spoken-language corpora and development of\
  \ speech processing tools have made possible the performance of \u201Clarge-scale\u201D\
  \ phonetic and sociolinguistic research. This study illustrates the usefulness of\
  \ such a large-scale approach\u2014using data from multiple corpora across a range\
  \ of English dialects, collected, and analyzed with the SPADE project\u2014to examine\
  \ how the pre-consonantal Voicing Effect (longer vowels before voiced than voiceless\
  \ obstruents, in e.g., bead vs. beat) is realized in spontaneous speech, and varies\
  \ across dialects and individual speakers. Compared with previous reports of controlled\
  \ laboratory speech, the Voicing Effect was found to be substantially smaller in\
  \ spontaneous speech, but still influenced by the expected range of phonetic factors.\
  \ Dialects of English differed substantially from each other in the size of the\
  \ Voicing Effect, whilst individual speakers varied little relative to their particular\
  \ dialect. This study demonstrates the value of large-scale phonetic research as\
  \ a means of developing our understanding of the structure of speech variability,\
  \ and illustrates how large-scale studies, such as those carried out within SPADE,\
  \ can be applied to other questions in phonetic and sociolinguistic research."
