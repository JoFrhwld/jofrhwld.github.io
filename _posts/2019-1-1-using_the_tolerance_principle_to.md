abstract: "Language acquisition is a well-established avenue for language change (Labov,\
  \ 2007). Given the theoretical importance of language acquisition to language change,\
  \ it is all the more important to formulate clear theories of transmission-based\
  \ change. In this paper, we provide a simulation method designed to test the plausibility\
  \ of different possible transmission-based changes, using the Tolerance Principle\
  \ (Yang, 2016) to determine precise points at which different possible changes may\
  \ become plausible for children acquiring language. We apply this method to a case\
  \ study of a complex change currently in progress: the allophonic restructuring\
  \ of /\xE6/ in Philadelphia English. Using this model, we are able to evaluate several\
  \ competing explanations of the ongoing change and determine that the allophonic\
  \ restructuring of /\xE6/ in Philadelphia English is mostly likely the result of\
  \ children acquiring language from mixed dialect input, consisting of approximately\
  \ 40\\% input from speakers with a nasal /\xE6/ split. We show that applying our\
  \ simulation to a phonological change allows us to make precise quantitative predications\
  \ about the progress of this change. Moreover, it forces us to reassess intuitively\
  \ plausible hypotheses about language change, such as grammatical simplification,\
  \ in a quantitative and independently motivated framework of acquisition."
