abstract: Bakovic (2005) proposes that patterns of sufficiently-similar segment avoidance
  are the result of interacting agreement and antigemination constraints, a pattern
  known as cross-derivational feeding (CDF). The bleeding interactions between epenthesis
  and assimilation which prevent adjacent sufficiently-similar segments in English
  are shown to follow, however, from extragrammatical considerations. Several case
  studies provide evidence against the major predictions of CDF.
