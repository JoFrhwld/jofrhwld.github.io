abstract: This study investigates the effects of different elicitation methods on
  the speech of a single speaker of San Francisco English who is participating in
  a systematic set of vocalic sound changes known as the California Vowel Shift [6].
  We contrast data obtained from classic sociolinguistic interview methods with data
  from self-recordings, as well as data from various methods for eliciting spontaneous
  speech that are typically used in laboratory settings.
