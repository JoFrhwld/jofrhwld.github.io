title: "Chapter 2: What is Phonetic Change?"
year: 2013
author: [ { name: "Josef Fruehwald", url: "https://jofrhwld.github.io" }]
abstract: "<p>In this chapter, I first disscuss the relationship between sound change and grammar, specifically how your theory of speakers' knowledge of their sound systems defines and circumscribes possible sound changes. I then lay out my minimal theoretical committments, and discuss my proposal that phonetic change ought to be understood as changing phonetic implementation. I compare quantitative predition of my proposal against a competing proposal that all sound change is phonological.</p>
<p>This is my favorite figure from this chapter, which outlines the quantitative prediction of what phonetic change would look like if it was actually phonological.</p>
