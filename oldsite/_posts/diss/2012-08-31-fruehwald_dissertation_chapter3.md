year: 2013
author: [ { name: "Josef Fruehwald", url: "//jofrhwld.github.io" }]
abstract: "<p>In this chapter, I describe the data that I use throughout the dissertation. It consists of vowel formant measurements drawn from the Philadelphia Neighborhood Corpus.</p>
<p>
My favorite figure from this chapter is a histogram of how many measurements we have per-speaker. It shows that most speakers have just a bit more than 1,000 vowel measurements.
