abstract: 'The detailed quantitative study of language change, as found in studies
  such as Labov (1994) and Kroch (1989), has raised two central questions for linguistic
  theory. The first is an issue in the theory of language change itself, namely: do
  changes in different components of the grammar progress in the same way? The second
  question addresses the relationship between the study of change and the development
  of synchronic linguistic theory: can quantitative, diachronic data help to choose
  between alternative analyses of synchronic facts? This paper addresses both of these
  questions with the case study of the loss of word-final stop fortition (frequently
  termed "devoicing") in the history of German, and concludes that the answer to both
  questions above is "yes".'
