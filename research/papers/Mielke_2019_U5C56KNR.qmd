abstract: "To test the hypothesis that intraspeaker variation in vowel formants is\
  \ related to the direction of diachronic change, we compare the direction of change\
  \ in apparent time with the axis of intraspeaker variation in F1 and F2 for vowel\
  \ phonemes in several corpora of North American and Scottish English. These vowels\
  \ were measured automatically with a scheme (tested on hand-measured vowels) that\
  \ considers the frequency, bandwidth, and amplitude of the \uFB01rst three formants\
  \ in reference to a prototype. In the corpus data, we \uFB01nd that the axis of\
  \ intraspeaker variation is typically aligned vertically, presumably corresponding\
  \ to the degree of jaw opening for individual tokens, but for the North American\
  \ GOOSE vowel, the axis of intraspeaker variation is aligned with the (horizontal)\
  \ axis of diachronic change for this vowel across North America. This may help to\
  \ explain why fronting and unrounding of high back vowels are common shifts across\
  \ languages."
