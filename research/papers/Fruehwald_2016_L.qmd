abstract: "The conventional wisdom regarding the diachronic process whereby phonetic\
  \ phenomena become phonologized appears to be the \u2018error accumulation\u2019\
  \ model, so called by Baker, Archangeli, and Mielke (2011). Under this model, biases\
  \ in the phonetic context result in production or perception errors, which are misapprehended\
  \ by listeners as target productions, and over time accumulate into new target productions.\
  \ In this article, I explore the predictions of the hypocorrection model for one\
  \ phonetic change (prevoiceless /ay/-raising) in detail. I argue that properties\
  \ of the phonetic context underpredict and mischaracterize the contextual conditioning\
  \ on this phonetic change. Rather, it appears that categorical, phonological conditioning\
  \ is present from the very onset of this change."
