abstract: "Coronal stop deletion (or\u201A`TD Deletion\u201A`) is the paradigm sociolinguistic\
  \ variable. It was first described in African American English (Labov et al., 1968)\
  \ as a rule whereby word final /Ct/ and /Cd/ clusters simplify by deleting the coronal\
  \ stop. It has since been found in many dialects and varieties of English. Aside\
  \ from the very regular phonological and phonetic factors which condition whether\
  \ TD Deletion applies, morphological structure also appears to have an effect. The\
  \ three morphological categories of primary interest are (i) monomorphemes}, (ii)\
  \ regular past tense verbs and (iii) semiweak past tense verbs.\nIn almost every\
  \ dialect studied, the order of morphological classes from least favoring deletion\
  \ to most favoring deletion is as given in (1).\n(1) monomorphemes > semiweak >\
  \ regular past tense\nIn this paper, I will be focusing on the difference between\
  \ semiweak and regular past tense. I will pursue a revised version of the analysis\
  \ in Guy & Boyd (1990), casting it in terms of Competing Grammars and Distributed\
  \ Morphology. Specifically, I will propose that the rate of phonological TD Deletion\
  \ is the same for the regular past and the semiweak. What leads to higher TD Absence\
  \ in the semiweak verbs is variable morphological absence of /t/, i.e., there is\
  \ a competing morphological analysis where the past tense of keep is simply \"kep\"\
  , instead of \"kept\"."
