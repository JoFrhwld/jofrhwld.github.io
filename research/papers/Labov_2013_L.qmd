abstract: "The study of sound change in progress in Philadelphia has been facilitated\
  \ by the application of forced alignment and automatic vowel measurement to a large\
  \ corpus of neighborhood studies, including 379 speakers with dates of birth from\
  \ 1888 to 1991. Two of the sound changes active in the 1970s show a linear pattern\
  \ of incrementation in succeeding decades. The fronting of back upgliding vowels\
  \ /aw/ and /ow/ shows a reversal in the direction of change, beginning with those\
  \ born after 1940. The study also finds a general withdrawal from two salient features\
  \ of local phonology, tense /\xE6h/ and /oh/, led by those with higher education.\
  \ Younger speakers with higher education have also reorganized the traditional Philadelphia\
  \ tense/lax split of short-a to form a nasal system with tensing before all and\
  \ only nasal consonants. The development of the Philadelphia vowel system can be\
  \ understood in the geographic context of neighboring dialects. Features in common\
  \ with North and North Midland dialects have accelerated in use while features in\
  \ common with South Midland and Southern dialects have been reversed in favor of\
  \ Northern patterns. The microevolution of a linguistic system can be seen here\
  \ as subject to phonological generalizations but driven by social evaluation as\
  \ features rise in level of salience for members of the speech community."
