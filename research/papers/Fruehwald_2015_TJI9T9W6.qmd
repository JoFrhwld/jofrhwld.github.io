abstract: "We present an analysis of an understudied construction found in Philadelphian\
  \ and Canadian English, and also in certain Vermont varieties. In this construction,\
  \ the participle of certain verbs can appear along with a form of the verb be and\
  \ a DP complement, producing strings like I\u2019m done my homework , I\u2019m finished\
  \ my fries , and (in Vermont) I\u2019m started the project . We show that the participle\
  \ in the construction is an adjectival passive, not a perfect construction. We further\
  \ argue that the internal argument DP in the construction is receiving Case from\
  \ the adjectival head a , similar to what happens in all English dialects with the\
  \ adjective worth , and that the internal argument is interpreted via a mechanism\
  \ of complement coercion. The microparametric variation we find across English dialects\
  \ with respect to the availability of this construction is accounted for by variation\
  \ in the selectional restrictions on the a head."
