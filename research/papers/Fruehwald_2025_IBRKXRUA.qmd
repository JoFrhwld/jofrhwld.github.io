abstract: This paper provides an overview of the discrete cosine transform (DCT) as
  a method for smoothing vowel formant tracks, as well as a procedure to take any
  speaker normalization method that has been defined for formant point measurements
  and define an equivalent method to be applied directly to DCT coefficients. This
  procedure is followed for three established normalization methods, and the difference
  between DCT normalization and formant point normalization is found to be marginal.
