abstract: "In this paper, I investigate to what degree phonetic uniformity in diachronic\
  \ vowels shifts can be accounted for in terms of a shared phonetic implementation\
  \ rule of phonological features [6, 10], versus a shared social evaluation of the\
  \ phonetic realizations [19]. I take a particular focus on the parallel fronting\
  \ and subsequent retraction of the GOOSE, GOAT and MOUTH vowels, as well as the\
  \ raising of the preconsonantal FACE and pre-voiceless PRICE vowels in Philadelphia,\
  \ drawing data from the Philadelphia Neighborhood Corpus [15]. Using generalized\
  \ additive models [21] I \uFB01t models for these vowels accounting for gender,\
  \ date of birth, educational attainment, and vowel duration using tensor product\
  \ smooths. Looking at the correlation of the byspeaker random intercepts, back vowel\
  \ fronting appears to be highly correlated, thus likely phonologically grounded,\
  \ while FACE and PRICE raising is not, thus likely socially grounded."
