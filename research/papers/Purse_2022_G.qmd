abstract: "Broad interest in probabilistic aspects of language has reignited debates\
  \ about a potential delineation between the shape of an abstract grammar and patterns\
  \ of language in use. A central topic in this debate is the relationship between\
  \ measures capturing aspects of language use, such as word frequency, and patterns\
  \ of variation. While it has become common practice to attend to frequency measures\
  \ in studies of linguistic variation, fundamental questions about exactly what linguistic\
  \ unit\u2019s frequency it is appropriate to measure in each case, and what this\
  \ implies about the representations or processing mechanisms at play, remain underexplored.\
  \ In the present study, we compare how three frequency measures account for variance\
  \ in Coronal Stop Deletion (CSD) based on large-scale corpus data from Philadelphia\
  \ English: whole-word frequency, stem frequency, and conditional (whole-word/stem)\
  \ frequency. While there is an effect of all three measures on CSD outcomes in monomorphemes,\
  \ the effect of conditional frequency is by far the most robust. Furthermore, only\
  \ conditional frequency has an effect on CSD rates in -ed suffixed words. Thus,\
  \ we suggest that frequency effects in CSD are best interpreted in terms of stem-conditional\
  \ predictability of a suffix or word-edge. These results lend support to the importance\
  \ of asking these fundamental questions about usage measures, and suggest that contemporary\
  \ approaches to frequency should take morphological complexity into account."
