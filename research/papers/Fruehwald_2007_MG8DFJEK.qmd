abstract: "Canadian Raising is typically described as the centralization of the nucleus\
  \ of /ay/ before voiceless segments. However some recent studies in areas affected\
  \ by Raising have shown that the current conditioning factors are not as regular\
  \ as reported previously (Vance, 1987; Dailey-O\u2019Cain, 1997; Hall, 2005). This\
  \ paper explores the status of Raising in Philadelphia. Examining data from 12 boys,\
  \ ages 14 to 19, it appears that Raising has lexicalized here as well. While Raising\
  \ occurs before a number of voiced stops and nasals, the words which experience\
  \ Raising most regularly suggest that it has spread due to its opaque applications."
