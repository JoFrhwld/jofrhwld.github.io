abstract: "In this paper, I argue that filled pause selection (um/uh) is a sociolinguistic\
  \ variable, conditioned by both internal and external factors. There appears to\
  \ be a language change in progress towards selecting um more often than uh. In all\
  \ respects, the (UHM) variable appears to pattern quantiatively just like all other\
  \ sociolinguistic variables which have been examined, even though the locus of (UHM)\
  \ variation would seem to be firmly in the speech planning domain. Combined with\
  \ the quantitative systematicity of sociolinguistic variables across the full range\
  \ of linguistic modules, I argue that the locus of variation may not be in the grammar,\
  \ but rather constitutes a separate domain of knowledge, perhaps what Preston (2004)\
  \ called the \u201Csociocultural selection device.\u201D"
