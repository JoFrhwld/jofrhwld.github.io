abstract: "This dissertation addresses the broad question about how phonology and\
  \ phonetics are interre- lated, specifically how phonetic language changes, which\
  \ gradually alter the phonetics of speech sounds, affect the phonological system\
  \ of the language, and vice versa. Some questions I address are: (i) What aspects\
  \ of speakers\u2019 knowledge of their language are changing during a phonetic change?\
  \ (ii) What is the relative timing of a phonetic change and phonological reanalysis?\
  \ (iii) Can a modular feed-forward model of phonology and phonetics account of the\
  \ observed patterns of phonetic change? (iv) What are the consequences of my results\
  \ for theories of phonology, phonetics, and language acquisition? (v) What unique\
  \ insight into the answers to these questions can the study of language change in\
  \ progress give us over other methodologies? To address these questions, I drew\
  \ data from the Philadelphia Neighborhood Corpus [PNC] (Labov and Rosenfelder, 2011),\
  \ a collection of sociolinguistic interviews carried out between 1973 and 2013.\
  \ Using the PNC data, I utilized a number of different statistical modeling techniques\
  \ to evaluate models of phonetic change and phonologization, including standard\
  \ mixed effects re- gression modeling in R (Bates, 2006), and hierarchical Bayesian\
  \ modeling via Hamiltonian Monte Carlo in Stan (Stan Development Team, 2012). My\
  \ results are challenging to the conventional wisdom that phonologization is a late-stage\
  \ reanalysis of phonetic coarticulatory and perceptual effects (e.g. Ohala, 1981).\
  \ Rather, it appears that phonologization occurs simultaneously with the onset of\
  \ phonetic changes. I arrive at this conclusion by examining the rate of change\
  \ of contextual vowel variants, and by investigating mismatches between which variants\
  \ are expected to change on phonetic grounds versus phono- logical grounds. In my\
  \ analysis, not only can a modular feed-forward model of phonology and phonetics\
  \ account for observed patterns of phonetic change, but must be appealed to in some\
  \ cases. These results revise some the facts to be explained by diachronic phonology,\
  \ and I suggest the question to be pursued ought to be how phonological innovations\
  \ happen when there are relatively small phonetic precursors."
