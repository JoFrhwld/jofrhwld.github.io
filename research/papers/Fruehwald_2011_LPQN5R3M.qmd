abstract: "Bakovi\u0107 (2005) proposes that patterns of sufficiently-similar segment\
  \ avoidance are the result of interacting agreement and antigemination constraints,\
  \ a pattern known as cross-derivational feeding (CDF). The bleeding interactions\
  \ between epenthesis and assimilation which prevent adjacent sufficiently-similar\
  \ segments in English are shown to follow, however, from extragrammatical considerations.\
  \ Several case studies provide evidence against the major predictions of CDF."
