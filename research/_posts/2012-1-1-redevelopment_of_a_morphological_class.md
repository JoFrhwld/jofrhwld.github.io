abstract: "Coronal stop deletion (or\u201A`TD Deletion\u201A`) is the paradigm sociolinguistic\
  \ variable. It was first described in African American English (Labov et al., 1968)\
  \ as a rule whereby word final /Ct/ and /Cd/ clusters simplify by deleting the coronal\
  \ stop. It has since been found in many dialects and varieties of English. Aside\
  \ from the very regular phonological and phonetic factors which condition whether\
  \ TD Deletion applies, morphological structure also appears to have an effect. The\
  \ three morphological categories of primary interest are (i) monomorphemes\\vphantom{\\\
  {}\\}, (ii) regular past tense verbs and (iii) semiweak past tense verbs. In almost\
  \ every dialect studied, the order of morphological classes from least favoring\
  \ deletion to most favoring deletion is as given in (1). (1) monomorphemes {\\textgreater}\
  \ semiweak {\\textgreater} regular past tense In this paper, I will be focusing\
  \ on the difference between semiweak and regular past tense. I will pursue a revised\
  \ version of the analysis in Guy \\& Boyd (1990), casting it in terms of Competing\
  \ Grammars and Distributed Morphology. Specifically, I will propose that the rate\
  \ of phonological TD Deletion is the same for the regular past and the semiweak.\
  \ What leads to higher TD Absence in the semiweak verbs is variable morphological\
  \ absence of /t/, i.e., there is a competing morphological analysis where the past\
  \ tense of keep is simply \"kep\", instead of \"kept\"."
