abstract: "This study reports the results of a crosslinguistic matched guise test\
  \ examining /s/ and pitch variation in judgments of sexual orientation and nonnormative\
  \ masculinity among English, French, and German listeners. Listeners responded to\
  \ /s/ and pitch manipulations in native and other language stimuli (English, French,\
  \ German, and Estonian). All listener groups rate higher pitch guises as more gay-\
  \ and effeminate-sounding than lower pitch guises. However, only English listeners\
  \ hear [s+] guises as more gay- and effeminate-sounding than [s] or [s\u2212] guises\
  \ for all stimuli languages. French and German listeners do not hear [s+] guises\
  \ as more gay- or effeminate-sounding in any stimulus language, despite this feature\u2019\
  s presence in native speech production. English listener results show evidence of\
  \ indexical transfer, when indexical knowledge is applied to the perception of unknown\
  \ languages. French and German listener results show how the enregistered status\
  \ of /s/ variation affects perception, despite crosslinguistic similarities in production."
