abstract: Berkson, Davis, and Strickler (2017) provide an invaluable report on incipient
  /ay/-raising in Fort Wayne, Indiana. Their data suggest that /ay/-raising conditioned
  strictly by phonetic voice-lessness is a possible early stage in the development
  of /ay/-raising. This raises a particularly vexing question of why /ay/-raising
  has gone on to be conditioned by phonological voicing in all North American varieties
  for which its interaction with /t, d/ flapping has been examined. It suggests that
  the process of phonologization reorganizes the distribution of phonetic variants,
  rather than simply discretizing phonetic precursors.
