abstract: In this study, we investigate crosslinguistic patterns in the alternation
  between um, a hesitation marker consisting of a neutral vowel followed by a final
  labial nasal, and uh, a hesitation marker consisting of a neutral vowel in an open
  syllable. Based on a quantitative analysis of a range of spoken and written corpora,
  we identify clear and consistent patterns of change in the use of these forms in
  various Germanic languages (English, Dutch, German, Norwegian, Danish, Faroese)
  and dialects (American English, British English), with the use of um increasing
  over time relative to the use of uh. We also find that this pattern of change is
  generally led by women and more educated speakers. Finally, we propose a series
  of possible explanations for this surprising change in hesitation marker usage that
  is currently taking place across Germanic languages.
