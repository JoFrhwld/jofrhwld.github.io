abstract: "This article reviews the role phonology plays in phonetic changes. After\
  \ \uFB01rst establishing what kinds of changes qualify as phonetic changes for the\
  \ purposes of discussion, and laying out the theoretical outlook that is adopted\
  \ here, I review the most obvious cases in which phonology plays a role in phonetic\
  \ change. These include (a) the way phonological contrast can lead to phonetic dispersion,\
  \ (b) the way phonological natural classes can de\uFB01ne a set of segments to undergo\
  \ a parallel phonetic shift, and (c) how phonological biases may lead to instances\
  \ of underphonologization. Throughout, I discuss alternative approaches to these\
  \ phenomena."
